			<h2>About Salary Benchmark</h2>
			<br/>
			<p>
				<b>We empower employees to earn the most for their skills.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				SalaryBenchmark is a free service funded by Stanford University that lets individuals compare their annual salary with the average for someone with similar skills, responsibilities, or tenure. We make it easy for people to see whether they are getting paid enough by their current employer.

				<b>The Problem</b>
				<br/><br/>
				It's not always easy to figure out whether you're being paid fairly. How much does someone with your educational background, work experience, or title get paid in your industry? Does someone with your job make more or less than you in a different city? It's hard for people to benchmark their company's compensation versus the rest of the industry.

				<b>The Solution</b>
				<br/><br/>
				At SalaryBenchmark, we believe workers should be able to easily, securely, and anonymously benchmark their current salary against the average for peers with similar skills, comparable backgrounds, or at competing companies. Our free comparison tool allows you to link your latest paystub information and see instantly where you stack up. Thinking of asking for a raise? Let SalaryBenchmark give you the hard evidence that you deserve more, so you can ask for an increase with intelligence and confidence.
