	<h1>TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOUR AUTHORIZATION</h1>
	<p>
		Welcome to Verix!
		<br/><br/>
		These terms and conditions are a legal agreement (this “Agreement”) between you (together with the business entity, if any, that you represent, “You”) and Arima Technologies, Inc. (dba Verix), with offices at 320 High Street, Palo Alto, CA 94301 (“Verix” or “we”, “us” or “our”), establishing terms and conditions under which You shall access and use the verification services and features available on Verix’s web-based platform (the “Verix Platform”).  The Verix Platform enables financial institutions (each, an “FI”) to verify the income, identity, employment and related information about individuals, like You, who seek financing or other business arrangements with such FIs.  Verix has a separate contract with FIs to provide such verification services for a fee.  You are not required to pay Verix for your use of the Verix Platform.  The Verix Platform is located at https://www.verixapi.com/, https://www.getmytaxtranscript.com/, and any related sub-domains, tools and services or through downloadable mobile or other applications through which the Verix Platform is made available by Verix from time to time (the “Website(s)”). 
		<br/><br/>
		You may be provided with access to the Verix Platform through a FI’s own systems or directly through our Website.  The FI which provides you with the link to the Verix Platform or which You otherwise authorize in connection with your use of the Verix Platform, is referred to herein as the “Authorized FI.”  In order to enable Verix to provide its services to the Authorized FI and the services contemplated herein, You will need to submit to the Verix Platform various sensitive personal information, including PII, “Your Information”) which will be made available by Verix to the Authorized FI as further set forth herein.  Verix will then use that information in order to access your individual tax records through a public online portal made available to individuals, like You, by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).  Verix will then provide the tax, wage, income and similar records made available by the IRS through that portal (“IRS Records”) and provide summaries and copies of all or a portion of such IRS Records to the Authorized FI.  The Authorized FI may then make decisions based in part on such summaries and IRS Records.  YOU AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT VERIX SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR, AND DOES NOT ADVISE YOU OR THE AUTHORIZED FI IN ANY WAY WITH REGARD TO, ANY DECISIONS OR ACTIONS OF THE AUTHORIZED FI IN CONNECTION WITH THE VERIX PLATFORM OR SUCH IRS RECORDS OR SUMMARIES.
		<br/><br/>
		The date You first agreed to this Agreement is referred to herein as the “Effective Date.”  Your use of the Verix Platform is also subject to our Privacy Policy available on our Website as updated from time to time.  You acknowledge and agree that the Verix Platform is in the early stages of its development and that the features and functionality are expected to change frequently. As used herein, “PII” means information that can be used to identify, contact, locate, distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. 
		<br/><br/>
		BEFORE YOU CLICK ON THE [“SUBMIT”] BUTTON OR SUBMIT ANY OF YOUR INFORMATION, CAREFULLY READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  BY CLICKING ON THE [“SUBMIT”] BUTTON OR SUBMITTING ANY OF YOUR INFORMATION, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY AND ARE BECOMING A PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT AND GRANTING THE AUTHORIZATION SET FORTH HEREIN.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THEN DO NOT CLICK “I ACCEPT”, AND YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO ACCESS AND/OR USE THE SERVICES.
