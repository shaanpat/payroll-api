		<h3>What is this service?</h3>
		<br/><br/>
		<p>
	        SalaryBenchmark is a free service funded by Stanford University that lets individuals compare their annual 
		salary with the average for someone with similar skills, responsibilities, or tenure. We make it easy for 
		people to see whether they are getting paid enough by their current employer. Every time someone uses SalaryBenchmark
		to compare their compensation level, their salary data gets anonymously added to our database of millions of employees,
		keeping our service accurate and up-to-date. SalaryBenchmark is the fastest, easiest, and safest way to make sure 
		you're getting paid what you're worth!

	    <h3>Where is your salary data coming from?</h3>
		<br/><br/>
	    <p>
		When an individual uses SalaryBenchmark, he or she can securely log into his or her payroll account, allowing
		SalaryBenchmark to pull the latest paystub. SalaryBenchmark then compares that paystub data against millions of other
		paystubs users have uploaded to the site. We only store and display anonymized data - your personal information is never
		shared with anyone.

	    <h3>What do I get from this service?</h3>
		<br/><br/>
	    <p>
	        When you share your paystub information with SalaryBenchmark, you unlock the ability to compare your payment level against
		an anonymized dataset of similar employees. Using our built-in filters, you can compare by job title, tenure, responsibilities, 
		educational background, geography, and more. SalaryBenchmark will display your level of pay versus the group average, bottom 
		quartile, and top quartile.

		<h3>What information do I need to provide?</h3>
		<br/><br/>
		<p>
	        To use this service, you must log into your current payroll account. For most users, this means providing their work email address 
		and login password for the payroll provided that their employer uses. Simply select your company's payroll provider from 
		our set of integrated partners and then enter your email and passowrd, as you would to log in and view your paystub normally.
